## 🎯 DETAILED SCRIPT

### [0:00 - 0:20] 🚨 OPENING - The Problem
**[Show: VS Code with Angular code using modern CSS]**

**Narration:**
> "Have you ever shipped code using a modern CSS feature like `:has()`, only to get a call that it's broken in your client's browser?
>
> This is a real problem: developers use modern web features without knowing if they work across all browsers."

**[Show: MDN browser compatibility table showing partial support]**

---

### [0:20 - 0:40] 💡 THE SOLUTION
**[Show: Project logo/title + architecture diagram]**

**Narration:**
> "Angular Baseline DevKit automatically analyzes your Angular code and detects web features that might not work in all browsers.
>
> It uses official web-features data - the same dataset powering MDN and Google Chrome - to give you accurate, up-to-date information."

---

### [0:40 - 1:40] 🔴 LIVE DEMO
**[Show: Terminal running commands]**

```bash
# Step 1: Switch to pre-prepared demo project
git checkout demo
cd demo-project
```

**Narration:**
> "Let's see it in action. I have an Angular project here with modern code that has typical compatibility issues."

**[Show briefly: Code with :has(), startViewTransition, etc.]**

```bash
# Step 2: Run analysis
npx @angular-baseline-devkit/cli analyze . --target widely
```

**[Show: Colored output with warnings]**

```
🔍 Analyzing Angular project...

⚠️ WARNING: Limited browser support detected
   Type: CSS
   Feature: ':has()' selector
   File: src/app/components/card/card.component.css:45
   Support: Chrome ✅ Firefox ❌ Safari ⚠️
   Suggestion: Use alternative class or JavaScript for this functionality

⚠️ WARNING: Modern API detected
   Type: JavaScript
   Feature: 'document.startViewTransition'
   File: src/app/services/animation.service.ts:23
   Baseline: newly (available since 2023)
   Suggestion: Implement fallback for older browsers

📊 Summary: 2 issues found
```

**Narration:**
> "As you can see, it found two issues: a CSS selector that doesn't work in Firefox, and a JavaScript API that's very new. Each warning includes specific suggestions."

### [1:40 - 2:10] 🔧 ESLINT INTEGRATION
**[Show: VS Code with red squiggly lines in code]**

**Narration:**
> "But the real power is ESLint integration. Add the plugin to your project..."

**[Show: .eslintrc.js]**
```javascript
{
  plugins: ['@angular-baseline-devkit/eslint-plugin'],
  rules: {
    '@angular-baseline-devkit/use-baseline': ['error', {
      target: 'widely' // maximum compatibility
    }]
  }
}
```

**Narration:**
> "And now issues appear right in your editor as you write code. No waiting until production to discover incompatibilities."

---

### [2:10 - 2:40] ⚙️ FLEXIBLE CONFIGURATION
**[Show: Different commands with various targets]**

```bash
# For maximum compatibility
baseline-devkit analyze --target widely

# For modern browsers
baseline-devkit analyze --target newly

# For specific year
baseline-devkit analyze --target 2023

# Strict mode for CI/CD
baseline-devkit analyze --strict --output json
```

**Narration:**
> "The tool is fully configurable. Choose your compatibility level: 'widely' for maximum support, 'newly' for modern features, or even a specific year.
>
> It also generates JSON reports for CI/CD integration."
